#
# This is the more-diagnostic sibling of 15_validate_server.sh:
#   - 15_validate_server.sh curls the LiteLLM router using
#     ``$LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`` from the host environment, which tells
#     you whether the *router* is healthy.
#   - 16_curl_test_bundle.sh reads ``model_deployments.yaml`` from the
#     bundle and curls each entry with **the key HELM will send**,
#     which tells you whether the *bundle* is good. If 15 passes but
#     16 fails, the bundle has the wrong api_key embedded — typically
#     because the .env wasn't sourced when 05_write_bundle.sh ran or
#     the profile's ``api_key_env`` doesn't match the .env's variable
#     name.

# Output: a per-deployment OK / FAIL line plus the first 200 chars of

# default (we do this so public HELM run_specs can be reused). Look
# in ``client_spec.args.openai_model_name`` for openai-compatible
# clients, ``client_spec.args.vllm_model_name`` for vllm-direct.
